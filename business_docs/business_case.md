## The Problem
Small retailers (grocery stores, pharmacies, electronics shops) are losing 20-30% of potential revenue due to poor inventory management:

### Pain Points:
- **Stockouts**: Lost sales when customers can't find products (15% revenue loss)
- **Overstock**: Money tied up in slow-moving inventory (10-15% waste)
- **Manual Decision Making**: Store owners guess reorder quantities and timing
- **No Early Warning**: Problems discovered only when shelves are empty or overflowing

### Why Small Retailers Struggle:
- Can't afford expensive enterprise inventory systems
- Limited data science expertise
- Need simple, actionable insights
- Budget constraints for technology adoption

## The Opportunity
**Target Market**: 500K+ small retailers in US alone
**Average Store Revenue**: $500K-2M annually
**Potential Savings**: $50K-300K per store per year
